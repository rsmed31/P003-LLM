Any two routers in an AS must have different IDs. In practice, the ID of a router is the IP address of one of its interfaces. The system supports OSPF multi-process. When a router runs multiple OSPF processes, you need to specify an ID for each process, which takes effect locally and has no interference on packet exchange between routers. Therefore, two routers having different process IDs can exchange packets. The system supports OSPF multi-instance. You can configure an OSPF process to run in a specified VPN instance to configure an association between the two. The configurations for routers in an area are performed on the area basis. Wrong configurations may cause communication failures, even routing information block or routing loops between neighboring routers. Follow these steps to configure OSPF basic functions: To do… Use the command… Remarks Enter system view system-view — Enable OSPF and enter its view ospf [ process-id | router-id router-id | vpn-instance instance-name ] * — Configure a description for the OSPF process description description Optional Not configured by default Configure an OSPF area and enter OSPF area view area area-id Required Not configured by default Configure a description for the area description description Optional Not configured by default Specify a network to enable OSPF on the interface attached to the network network ip-address wildcard-mask Required Not configured by default\n\n\nOperation Manual – OSPF H3C S9500 Series Routing Switches Chapter 1 OSPF Configuration\n\nNote: z An OSPF process ID is unique, including the process ID for OSPF multi-instance, which cannot be the same as any previously configured ID. z A network segment can only belong to one area. z It is recommended to configure a description for each OSPF process to help identify purposes of processes and for ease of management and memorization. z It is recommended to configure a description for each area to help identify purposes of areas and for ease of management and memorization.\n\n1.4 Configuring OSPF Area Parameters Splitting an OSPF AS into multiple areas reduces the number of LSAs on networks and extends OSPF application. For those non-backbone areas residing on the AS boundary, you can configure them as Stub areas to further reduce the size of routing tables on routers in these areas and the number of LSAs. A stub area cannot redistribute routes, thus introducing the concept of NSSA, where type 7 LSAs (NSSA External LSAs) are advertised. Type 7 LSAs originate from the ASBR in a NSSA area. When arriving at the ABR in the NSSA area, these LSAs will be translated into type 5 LSAs for advertisement to other areas. Non-backbone areas exchange routing information via the backbone area. Therefore, the backbone and non-backbone areas, including the backbone itself must maintain connectivity. If necessary physical links are not available for this connectivity maintenance, you can configure virtual links to solve it. 1.4.1 Prerequisites Before configuring an OSPF area, you have configured: z IP addresses for interfaces, making neighboring nodes accessible with each other at network layer. z OSPF basic functions\n\n\nOperation Manual – OSPF H3C S9500 Series Routing Switches Chapter 1 OSPF Configuration",
