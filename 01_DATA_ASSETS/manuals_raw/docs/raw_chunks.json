OSPF is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) developed by the OSPF working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). OSPF was designed expressly for IP networks and it supports IP subnetting and tagging of externally derived routing information. OSPF also allows packet authentication and uses IP multicast when sending and receiving packets. Cisco supports RFC 1253, OSPF Version 2 Management Information Base, August 1991. The OSPF MIB defines an IP routing protocol that provides management information related to OSPF and is supported by Cisco routers.

At the intradomain level, OSPF can import routes learned via Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS). OSPF routes can also be exported into IGRP, RIP, and IS-IS. At the interdomain level, OSPF can import routes learned via Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

You are not required to alter any of these parameters, but some interface parameters must be consistent across all routers in an attached network. Those parameters are controlled by the ip ospf hello-interval, ip ospf dead-interval, and ip ospf authentication-key interface configuration commands. Therefore, if you do configure any of these parameters, ensure that the configurations for all routers on your network have compatible values.

Configuring NBMA networks as either broadcast or nonbroadcast assumes that there are virtual circuits (VCs) from every router to every router, that is, a fully meshed network. This is not true in some cases, for example, because of cost constraints or when you have only a partially meshed network.

On point-to-multipoint broadcast networks, there is no need to specify neighbors.

On any point-to-multipoint interface (broadcast or not), the Cisco IOS software assumed that the cost to each neighbor was equal. The cost was configured with the ip ospf cost interface configuration command. In reality, the bandwidth to each neighbor is different, so the cost should differ.

An NSSA ASBR generates the Type 7 LSA so that the routes can be redistributed, and an NSSA ABR translates the Type 7 LSA into a Type 5 LSA, which can be flooded throughout the whole OSPF routing domain. Summarization and filtering are supported during the translation. RFC 3101 allows you to configure an NSSA ABR router as a forced NSSA LSA translator.

The OSPF metric is calculated as the ref-bw value divided by the bandwidth value, with the ref-bw value equal to 108 by default, and the bandwidth value determined by the bandwidth interface configuration command. The calculation gives FDDI a metric of 1. If you have multiple links with high bandwidth, you might want to specify a larger number to differentiate the cost on those links.

Routes within an area are intra-area; routes to another area are interarea; and routes from another routing domain learned via redistribution are external.

Refresh packets are sent to keep the LSA from expiring, whether there has been a change in the network topology or not. Checksumming is performed on all LSAs every 10 minutes. The router keeps track of LSAs that it generates and LSAs that it receives from other routers. The router refreshes LSAs that it generated; it ages the LSAs that it received from other routers. Prior to the LSA group pacing feature, the Cisco software would perform refreshing on a single timer and checksumming and aging on another timer. In the case of refreshing, for example, the software would scan the whole database every 30 minutes, refreshing every LSA that the router generated, no matter how old it was. The figure below illustrates all the LSAs being refreshed at once. This process wasted CPU resources because only a small portion of the database needed to be refreshed. A large"},

The default value of pacing between LSA groups is 240 seconds (4 minutes). The range is from 10 seconds to 1800 seconds (30 minutes). By default, OSPF floods new LSAs over all interfaces in the same area, except the interface on which the LSA arrives. Some redundancy is desirable, because it ensures robust flooding. However, too much redundancy can waste bandwidth and might destabilize the network due to excessive link and CPU usage in certain topologies. An example would be a fully meshed topology.

If this feature is deployed within a regular area, all other regular areas must also support this feature before the demand circuit functionality can take effect because Type 5 external LSAs are flooded throughout all areas. • Hub-and-spoke network topologies that have a point-to-multipoint (P2MP) OSPF interface type on a hub might not"},

To resolve this problem, reduce the number of OSPF links or increase the huge buffer size by entering the buffers huge size size command.

With a huge buffer size of 18024 bytes, there can be a maximum of 1485 link descriptions.

Essentially this is the same as the more common notation 192.168.1.0/24. Note that the network command includes the text area 0.

The area number is a 32-bit integer that is typically written in either dotted decimal format a.b.c.d or as an integer like 0 or 1. 2.

The following list outlines key features supported in the Cisco OSPF implementation: • Stub areas—The definition of stub areas is supported. • Route redistribution—Routes learned via any IP routing protocol can be redistributed into any other IP routing protocol. At the intradomain level, OSPF can import routes learned via Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), Routing Information Protocol (RIP), and Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS). OSPF routes can also be exported into IGRP, RIP, and IS-IS. At the interdomain level, OSPF can"},
{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 140, "text": "-IS). OSPF routes can also be exported into IGRP, RIP, and IS-IS. At the interdomain level, OSPF can import routes learned via Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF routes can be exported into EGP and BGP. • Authentication—Plain text and message-digest algorithm 5 (MD5) authentication among neighboring routers within an area is supported. • Routing interface parameters—Configurable parameters supported include interface output cost, retransmission interval, interface transmit delay, router priority, router “dead” and hello intervals, and authentication key. • Virtual links—Virtual links are supported. • Not-so-stubby area (NSSA)—RFC 3101, which replaces and is backward compatible with RFC 1587. • OSPF over demand circuit—RFC 1793.

Route Distribution for OSPF You can specify route redistribution; see the task “Redistribute Routing Information” in the Network Protocols Configuration Guide, Part 1, for information on how to configure route redistribution. The Cisco OSPF implementation allows you to alter certain interface-specific OSPF parameters, as needed. You are not required to alter any of these parameters, but some interface parameters must be consistent across all routers in an attached network. Those parameters are controlled by the ip ospf hello-interval, ip ospf dead-interval, and ip ospf authentication-key interface configuration commands. Therefore, if"},

OSPF Network Type You have the choice of configuring your OSPF network type as either broadcast or NBMA, regardless of the default media type. Using this feature, you can configure broadcast networks as NBMA networks when, for example, you have routers in your network that do not support multicast addressing. You also can configure NBMA networks (such as X.25, Frame Relay, and SMDS) as broadcast networks. This feature saves you from needing to configure neighbors, as described in the “Configuring OSPF for Nonbroadcast Networks”section later in this module. Configuring NBMA networks as either broadcast or nonbroadcast assumes that there are virtual circuits (VCs) from every router to every router, that is, a fully meshed network. This is not true in some cases, for example, because of cost constraints or when you have only a partially meshed network. In these cases, you can configure the OSPF"},

An OSPF point-to-multipoint interface is defined as a numbered point-to-point interface having one or more neighbors. It creates multiple host routes. An OSPF point-to-multipoint network has the following benefits compared to NBMA and point-to-point networks: • Point-to-multipoint is easier to configure because it requires no configuration of neighbor commands, it consumes only one IP subnet, and it requires no designated router election. • It costs less because it does not require a fully meshed topology. • It is more reliable because it maintains connectivity in the event of VC failure.

However, you can specify neighbors with the neighbor router configuration command, in which case you should specify a cost to that neighbor. Before the point-to-multipoint keyword was added to the ip ospf network interface configuration command, some OSPF point-to-multipoint protocol traffic was treated as multicast traffic. Therefore, the neighbor router configuration command was not needed for point-to-multipoint interfaces because multicast took care of the traffic. Hello, update, and acknowledgment messages were sent using multicast. In particular, multicast hello messages discovered all neighbors dynamically. On any point-to-multipoint interface (broadcast or not), the Cisco IOS software assumed that the cost to each neighbor was equal.

IP Routing: OSPF Configuration Guide 5 Configuring OSPF Route Distribution for OSPF\n\n\nBecause many routers might be attached to an OSPF network, a designated router is selected for the network. Special configuration parameters are needed in the designated router selection if broadcast capability is not configured. These parameters need only be configured in those devices that are themselves eligible to become the designated router or backup designated router (in other words, routers with a nonzero router priority value). You can specify the following neighbor parameters, as required: • Priority for a neighboring router • Nonbroadcast poll interval On point-to-multipoint, nonbroadcast networks, use the neighbor router"},

Assigning a cost to a neighbor is optional. Prior to Cisco IOS Release 12.0, some customers were using point-to-multipoint on nonbroadcast media (such as classic IP over ATM), so their routers could not dynamically discover their neighbors. This feature allows the neighbor router configuration command to be used on point-to-multipoint interfaces.

{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 148, "text": "ea because routes for the remote site could not be redistributed into the stub area, and two routing protocols needed to be maintained. A simple protocol such as RIP was usually run and handled the redistribution. With NSSA, you can extend OSPF to cover the remote connection by defining the area between the corporate router and the remote router as an NSSA. As with OSPF stub areas, NSSA areas cannot be injected with distributed routes via Type 5 LSAs. Route redistribution into an NSSA area is possible only with a special type of LSA that is known as Type 7 that can exist only in an NSSA area. An NSSA ASBR generates the Type 7 LSA so that the routes can be redistributed, and an NSSA ABR translates the Type 7 LSA into a Type 5 LSA, which can be flooded throughout the whole OSPF routing domain. Summarization and filtering are supported during the translation. RFC 3101 allows you to configure an NSSA ABR router as a forced NSSA LSA translator. This means that the NSSA ABR router will"},

If the network numbers in an area are assigned in a way such that they are contiguous, you can configure the ABR to advertise a summary route that covers all the individual networks within the area that fall into the specified range. When routes from other protocols are redistributed into OSPF (as described in the module \"Configuring IP Routing Protocol-Independent Features\"), each route is advertised individually in an external LSA.

The virtual link must be configured in both routers. The configuration information in each router consists of the other virtual endpoint (the other ABR) and the nonbackbone area that the two routers have in common (called the transit area). Note that virtual links cannot be configured through stub areas. You can force an ASBR to generate a default route into an OSPF routing domain.

OSPF automatically prefers a loopback interface over any other kind, and it chooses the highest IP address among all loopback interfaces. If no loopback interfaces are present, the highest IP address in the router is chosen. You cannot tell OSPF to use any particular interface. In Cisco IOS Release 10.3 and later releases, by default OSPF calculates the OSPF metric for an interface according to the bandwidth of the interface. For example, a 64-kbps link gets a metric of 1562, and a T1 link gets a metric of 64. The OSPF metric is calculated as the ref-bw value divided by the bandwidth value, with the ref-bw value equal to 108 by default, and the bandwidth value determined by the bandwidth interface configuration command.

An administrative distance is a rating of the trustworthiness of a routing information source, such as an individual router or a group of routers. Numerically, an administrative distance is an integer from 0 to 255. In general, the higher the value, the lower the trust rating. An administrative distance of 255 means the routing information source cannot be trusted at all and should be ignored. OSPF uses three different administrative distances: intra-area, interarea, and external. Routes within an area are intra-area; routes to another area are interarea; and routes from another routing domain learned via redistribution are external. The default distance for each type of route is 110.

Original LSA Behavior Each OSPF LSA has an age, which indicates whether the LSA is still valid. Once the LSA reaches the maximum age (1 hour), it is discarded. During the aging process, the originating router sends a refresh packet every 30 minutes to refresh the LSA. Refresh packets are sent to keep the LSA from expiring, whether there has been a change in the network topology or not. Checksumming is performed on all LSAs every 10 minutes. The router keeps track of LSAs that it generates and LSAs that it receives from other routers. The router refreshes LSAs that it generated; it ages the LSAs that it received from other routers. Prior to the LSA group pacing feature, the Cisco software would perform refreshing on a single timer and checksumming and aging on another timer. In the case of refreshing, for example, the"},

A large OSPF database (several thousand LSAs) could have thousands of LSAs with different ages. Refreshing on a single timer resulted in the age of all LSAs becoming synchronized, which resulted in much CPU processing at once. Furthermore, a large number of LSAs could cause a sudden increase of network traffic, consuming a large amount of network resources in a short time.

To again use the example of refreshing, each LSA gets refreshed when it is 30 minutes old, independent of other LSAs. So the CPU is used only when necessary. However, LSAs being refreshed at frequent, random intervals would require many packets for the few refreshed LSAs that the router must send, which would be inefficient use of bandwidth. Therefore, the router delays the LSA refresh function for an interval of time instead of performing it when the individual timers are reached. The accumulated LSAs constitute a group, which is then refreshed and sent out in one packet or more. Thus, the refresh packets are paced, as are the checksumming and aging. The pacing interval is configurable; it defaults to 4 minutes, which is randomized to further avoid synchronization.

For example, if you have approximately 10,000 LSAs, decreasing the pacing interval would benefit you. If you have a very small database (40 to 100 LSAs), increasing the pacing interval to 10 to 20 minutes might benefit you slightly. The default value of pacing between LSA groups is 240 seconds (4 minutes). The range is from 10 seconds to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

The growth of the Internet has increased the importance of scalability in IGPs such as OSPF. By design, OSPF requires LSAs to be refreshed as they expire after 3600 seconds.

Prerequisites for IPv6 Routing: OSPFv3 • Complete the OSPFv3 network strategy and planning for your IPv6 network. For example, you must decide whether multiple areas are required. • Enable IPv6 unicast routing. • Enable IPv6 on the interface. IP Routing: OSPF Configuration Guide 57\n\n\nRestrictions for IPv6 Routing: OSPFv3 When running a dual-stack IP network with OSPF version 2 for IPv4 and OSPFv3, be careful when changing the defaults for commands used to enable OSPFv3. Changing these defaults may affect your OSPFv3 network, possibly adversely. Information About IPv6 Routing: OSPFv3 How OSPFv3 Works OSPFv3 is a routing protocol for IPv4 and IPv6. It is a link-state protocol, as opposed to a distance-vector protocol. Think of a link as being an interface on a networking device. A link-state protocol makes its routing decisions based on the states of the links that connect"},
{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 235, "text": "ice. A link-state protocol makes its routing decisions based on the states of the links that connect source and destination machines. The state of a link is a description of that interface and its relationship to its neighboring networking devices. The interface information includes the IPv6 prefix of the interface, the network mask, the type of network it is connected to, the devices connected to that network, and so on. This information is propagated in various type of link-state advertisements (LSAs). A device’s collection of LSA data is stored in a link-state database. The contents of the database, when subjected to the Dijkstra algorithm, result in the creation of the OSPF routing table. The difference between the database and the routing table is that the database contains a complete collection of raw data; the routing table contains a list of shortest paths to known destinations via specific device interface ports. OSPFv3, which is described in RFC 5340, supports IPv6 and IPv4"},
{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 236, "text": "via specific device interface ports. OSPFv3, which is described in RFC 5340, supports IPv6 and IPv4 unicast AFs. Comparison of OSPFv3 and OSPF Version 2 Much of OSPF version 3 is the same as in OSPF version 2. OSPFv3, which is described in RFC 5340, expands on OSPF version 2 to provide support for IPv6 routing prefixes and the larger size of IPv6 addresses. In OSPFv3, a routing process does not need to be explicitly created. Enabling OSPFv3 on an interface will cause a routing process, and its associated configuration, to be created. In OSPFv3, each interface must be enabled using commands in interface configuration mode. This feature is different from OSPF version 2, in which interfaces are indirectly enabled using the device configuration mode. When using a nonbroadcast multiaccess (NBMA) interface in OSPFv3, you must manually configure the device with the list of neighbors. Neighboring devices are identified by their device ID. In IPv6, you can configure many address prefixes on"},
{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 237, "text": "oring devices are identified by their device ID. In IPv6, you can configure many address prefixes on an interface. In OSPFv3, all address prefixes on an interface are included by default. You cannot select some address prefixes to be imported into OSPFv3; either all address prefixes on an interface are imported, or no address prefixes on an interface are imported. Unlike OSPF version 2, multiple instances of OSPFv3 can be run on a link. OSPF automatically prefers a loopback interface over any other kind, and it chooses the highest IP address among all loopback interfaces. If no loopback interfaces are present, the highest IP address in the device is chosen. You cannot tell OSPF to use any particular interface.

Type 1 LSAs are also used to advertise stub networks. In OSPFv3, these LSAs have no address information and are network-protocol-independent. In OSPFv3, device interface information may be spread across multiple device LSAs. Receivers must concatenate all device LSAs originated by a given device when running the SPF calculation. • Network LSAs (Type 2)—Describes the link-state and cost information for all devices attached to the network.

In OSPFv3, addresses for these LSAs are expressed as prefix, prefix length instead of address, mask. The default route is expressed as a prefix with length 0. • Interarea-device LSAs for ASBRs (Type 4)—Advertises the location of an ASBR. Devices that are trying to reach an external network use these advertisements to determine the best path to the next hop. Type 4 LSAs are generated by ABRs on behalf of ASBRs. • Autonomous system external LSAs (Type 5)—Redistributes routes from another autonomous system, usually from a different routing protocol into OSPFv3.

Load Balancing in OSPFv3 When a device learns multiple routes to a specific network via multiple routing processes (or routing protocols), it installs the route with the lowest administrative distance in the routing table.

Each routing process calculates its cost differently and the costs may need to be manipulated in order to achieve load balancing. OSPFv3 performs load balancing automatically in the following way. If OSPFv3 finds that it can reach a destination through more than one interface and each path has the same cost, it installs each path in the routing table. The only restriction on the number of paths to the same destination is controlled by the maximum-paths command. The default maximum paths is 16, and the range is from 1 to 64. Addresses Imported into OSPFv3 When importing the set of addresses specified on an interface on which OSPFv3 is running into OSPFv3, you cannot select specific addresses to be imported.

The combination of the cryptographic authentication algorithm and the key is known as a Security Association (SA). The authentication key on a key chain is valid for a specific time period called lifetime. An SA has the following configurable lifetimes: • Accept lifetime • Send lifetime While adding a new key, the Send lifetime is set to a time in the future so that the same key can be configured on all devices in the network before the new key becomes operational.

This feature introduces three configuration IP Routing: OSPF Configuration Guide 111\n\n\noptions that allow you to configure a router that is running the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol to advertise a maximum or infinite metric to all neighbors. When any of these three configuration options are enabled on a router, the router will originate link-state advertisements (LSAs) with a maximum metric (LSInfinity: 0xFFFF) through all nonstub links.

Directly connected links in a stub network are not affected by the configuration of a maximum or infinite metric because the cost of a stub link is always set to the output interface cost. Note Maximum Metric Allows Routing Tables to Converge Two configuration options introduced by the OSPF Stub Router Advertisement feature allow you to bring a new router into a network without immediately routing traffic through the new router.

These configuration options are useful because Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) converge very quickly upon a router during startup or after a reload, often before Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing tables have completely converged. If neighbor routers forward traffic through a router while that router is building BGP routing tables, packets that have been received for other destinations may be dropped. Advertising a maximum metric during startup will allow routing tables to converge before traffic that is destined for other networks is sent through the router. The following two configuration options enable a router to advertise a maximum metric at startup: • You can configure a timer to advertise a maximum metric when the router is started or reloaded. When this option is configured, the router will advertise a maximum metric, which forces neighbor routers to select alternate paths until the timer expires.

The configurable range of the timer is from 5 to 86,400 seconds. • You can configure a router to advertise a maximum metric at startup until BGP routing tables converge or until the default timer expires (600 seconds). Once BGP routing tables converge or the default timer expires, the router will advertise accurate (normal) metrics and other routers will send traffic to this router, depending on the cost. Maximum Metric Allows Graceful Shutdown of a Router The third configuration option introduced by the OSPF Stub Router Advertisement feature allows you to gracefully remove a router from the network by advertising a maximum metric through all links, which allows other routers to select alternate paths for transit traffic to follow before the router is shut down.

This situation may occur when there is a switch between other routers and the router that is shut down. Packets may be dropped while the neighbor routing tables reconverge.

A sham-link ensures that OSPF client sites that share a backdoor link can communicate over the MPLS VPN backbone and participate in VPN services. Flexible Routing in an MPLS VPN Configuration In an MPLS VPN configuration, the OSPF cost configured with a sham-link allows you to decide if OSPF client site traffic will be routed over a backdoor link or through the VPN backbone. Using OSPF in PE-CE Router Connections In an MPLS VPN configuration, the OSPF protocol is one way you can connect customer edge (CE) routers to service provider edge (PE) routers in the VPN backbone.

IP Routing: OSPF Configuration Guide 130 OSPF Sham-Link Support for MPLS VPN Restrictions on OSPF Sham-Link Support for MPLS VPN\n\n\nWhen OSPF is used to connect PE and CE routers, all routing information learned from a VPN site is placed in the VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) instance associated with the incoming interface.

The MPLS VPN superbackbone provides an additional level of routing hierarchy to interconnect the VPN sites running OSPF. When OSPF routes are propagated over the MPLS VPN backbone, additional information about the prefix in the form of BGP extended communities (route type, domain ID extended communities) is appended to the BGP update. This community information is used by the receiving PE router to decide the type of link-state advertisement (LSA) to be generated when the BGP route is redistributed to the OSPF PE-CE process. In this way, internal OSPF routes that belong to the same VPN and are advertised over the VPN backbone are seen as interarea routes on the remote sites.

The interface on which OSPF is configured belongs to only one area at any given point of time. This causes suboptimal routing for certain topologies, due to intra-area route preference over the interarea routes. Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) allows a single physical link to be shared by multiple areas. This creates an intra-area path in each of the corresponding areas sharing the same link. All areas have an interface on which OSPF is configured. One of these interfaces is designated as the primary interface and others as secondary interfaces.

Information About OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer Overview of OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer Prior to the OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer, OSPFv3 IPsec as defined in RFC 4552 was the only mechanism for authenticating protocol packets. The OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer feature defines an alternative mechanism to authenticate OSPFv3 protocol packets that additionally provides a packet replay protection via sequence number and does not have any platform dependencies.

{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 452, "text": "SPFv3 devices append a special data block, that is, Authentication Trailer, to the end of the OSPFv3 packets. The length of the Authentication Trailer is not included in the length of the OSPFv3 packet but is included in the IPv6 payload length. The Link-Local Signaling (LLS) block is established by the L-bit setting in the “OSPFv3 Options” field in OSPFv3 hello and database description packets. If present, the LLS data block is included along with the OSPFv3 packet in the cryptographic authentication computation. A new Authentication Trailer (AT)-bit is introduced into the OSPFv3 Options field. OSPFv3 devices must set the AT-bit in OSPFv3 Hello and Database Description packets to indicate that all the packets on this link will include an Authentication Trailer.

The AT-bit must be set in all OSPFv3 Hello and Database Description packets that contain an Authentication Trailer. To configure the Authentication Trailer, OSPFv3 utilizes existing Cisco IOS key chain command. For outgoing OSPFv3 packets, the following rules are used to select the key from the key chain: • Select the key that is the last to expire. • If two keys have the same stop time, select the one with the highest key ID. The security association (SA) ID maps to the authentication algorithm and the secret key, which is used to generate and verify the message digest.

If no valid key is available then the packet is sent without the authentication trailer. When packets are received, the key ID is used to look up the data for that key. If the key ID is not found in the key chain or if the SA is not valid, the packet is dropped. Otherwise, the packet is verified using the algorithm and the key that is configured for the key ID. Key chains support rollover using key lifetimes. A new key can be added to a key chain with the send start time set in the future. This setting allows the new key to be configured on all devices before the keys are actually used.

Microloops are formed as a result of the fact that each node on the path does its calculation at different times and independently of other nodes. If certain nodes converge and sends traffic to a neighbor node, which has not converged yet, traffic may be looped between these two nodes. Microloops are formed between the router where the failure is detected and its neighbors. Local microloops are created in cases where there is no local loop-free alternate (LFA) backup available in ring or square topologies. In such topologies, remote LFA provides a backup, but the fast-convergence benefit of the remote LFA cannot be completely utilized due to the high probability of the local microloop creation. Avoiding the local micro loop provides a significant improvement in the fast convergence in the ring and square topologies.

Packet drop is a critical issue in multimedia traffic. There is a demand to reduce multicast traffic loss to the range of milliseconds or to zero packet loss. The zero packet loss solution for multicast in case of single link failure is also known as live-live. In a live-live network, multicast streams (typically two flows) form their own reverse path forwarding (RPF)/shortest path trees (SPT) over diversified physical links, so that failure on one link does not affect multicast traffic on other link. The existing multi topology technology in Cisco IOS software supports the multiple multicast topologies.

PIM then decides which RIB to use for RPF lookup. PIM RPF topology is a collection of routes used by PIM to perform the RPF operation when building shared or source trees. In a multi topology environment, multiple RPF topologies can be created in the same network. A particular source may be reachable in only one of the topologies or in several of them through different paths. To select the RPF topology for a particular multicast distribution tree, consider the following: 1 Configure a policy that maps a group range to a topology. When RPF information needs to be resolved for the RP or the sources for a group within the range, the RPF lookup takes place in the specified topology. This can be used for PIM Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)/source-specific multicast (SSM)/Bidirectional(Bidir) PIM. 2 Configure a policy that maps a source prefix range to a topology. This"},

This feature causes devices that are configured not to advertise forwarding addresses into the backbone to direct forwarded traffic to the translating NSSA ASBRs. When to Suppress OSPF Forwarding Address in Translated Type-5 LSAs In the figure below, it would be advantageous to filter Area 2 addresses from Area 0 to minimize the number of routes introduced into the backbone (Area 0). However, using the area rangecommand to consolidate and summarize routes at the area boundary--filtering the Area 2 addresses--will not work because the"},

If these Type-7 LSA forwarding addresses have been filtered out of Area 0, the backbone routers cannot reach the prefixes advertised in the translated Type-5 LSAs (autonomous system external LSAs).

The defaults are 10 seconds for an Ethernet link and 30 seconds for a non broadcast link. Hello packets include a list of all neighbors for which a hello packet has been received within the dead interval. The dead interval is also a configurable interval (in seconds), and defaults to four times the value of the hello interval. The value of all hello intervals must be the same within a network. Likewise, the value of all dead intervals must be the same within a network. These two intervals work together to maintain connectivity by indicating that the link is operational. If a router does not receive a hello packet from a neighbor within the dead interval, it will declare that neighbor to be down.

To understand fast hello packets, you should already understand the relationship between OSPF hello packets and the dead interval. See the section OSPF Hello Interval and Dead Interval, on page 252. OSPF fast hello packets are achieved by using the ip ospf dead-interval command. The dead interval is set to 1 second, and the hello-multiplier value is set to the number of hello packets you want to send during that 1 second, thus providing subsecond or \"fast\" hello packets. When fast hello packets are configured on the interface, the hello interval advertised in the hello packets that are sent out this interface is set to 0. The hello interval in the hello packets received over this interface is ignored. The dead interval must be consistent on a segment, whether it is set to 1 second (for fast hello packets) or set to any other value.

Benefits of OSPF Fast Hello Packets The benefit of the OSPF Support for Fast Hello Packets feature is that your OSPF network will experience faster convergence time than it would without fast hello packets. This feature allows you to detect lost neighbors within 1 second.

When changes to a Type-1 or Type-2 link-state advertisement (LSA) occur in an area, the entire SPT is recomputed. In many cases, the entire SPT need not be recomputed because most of the tree remains unchanged. Incremental SPF allows the system to recompute only the affected part of the tree. Recomputing only a portion of the tree rather than the entire tree results in faster OSPF convergence and saves CPU resources.

IP Routing: OSPF Configuration Guide 285\n\n\nInformation About OSPF LSA Throttling Benefits of OSPF LSA Throttling Prior to the OSPF LSA Throttling feature, LSA generation was rate-limited for 5 seconds. That meant that changes in an LSA could not be propagated in milliseconds, so the OSPF network could not achieve millisecond convergence. The OSPF LSA Throttling feature is enabled by default and allows faster OSPF convergence (in milliseconds). This feature can be customized. One command controls the generation (sending) of LSAs, and another command controls the receiving interval. This feature also provides a dynamic mechanism to slow down the frequency of LSA updates in OSPF during times of network instability. How OSPF LSA Throttling Works The timers throttle lsa all command controls the generation (sending) of LSAs. The first LSA is always generated immediately upon an OSPF topology change, and the next LSA generated"},
{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 609, "text": "e first LSA is always generated immediately upon an OSPF topology change, and the next LSA generated is controlled by the minimum start interval. The subsequent LSAs generated for the same LSA are rate-limited until the maximum interval is reached. The \"same LSA\" is defined as an LSA instance that contains the same LSA ID number, LSA type, and advertising router ID. The timers lsa arrival command controls the minimum interval for accepting the same LSA. If an instance of the same LSA arrives sooner than the interval that is set, the LSA is dropped. It is recommended that the arrival interval be less than or equal to the hold-time interval of the timers throttle lsa all command.

Information About OSPF Support for Unlimited Software VRFs per PE Router Before Cisco IOS Releases 12.3(4)T and 12.0(27)S, a separate OSPF process was necessary for each VRF that receives VPN routes via OSPF. When VPNs are deployed, an MPLS Provider Edge (PE) router will be running both multiprotocol Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for VPN distribution, and Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) for PE-P connectivity. OSPF is commonly used as the IGP between a customer edge (CE) router and a PE router. OSPF was not scalable in a VPN deployment because of the limit of 32 processes. By default, one process is used for connected routes and another process is used for static routes; therefore only 28 processes can be created for VRFs.

When other routers in the network have been misconfigured, they may generate a high volume of LSAs, for instance, to redistribute large numbers of prefixes. This protection mechanism prevents routers from receiving a large number of LSAs and therefore experiencing CPU and memory shortages.

When the configured maximum number of LSAs is exceeded, the router will send a notification. If the count of received LSAs is still higher than the configured maximum after one minute, the OSPF process takes down all adjacencies and clears the OSPF database. In this ignore state, all OSPF packets received on any interface that belongs to this OSPF process are ignored and no OSPF packets are generated on any of these interfaces. The OSPF process remains in the ignore state for the time configured by the ignore-time keyword of the max-lsa command. Each time the OSPF process gets into an ignore state a counter is incremented. If this counter exceeds the number of minutes configured by the ignore-count keyword, the OSPF process stays permanently in the same ignore state and manual intervention is required to get the OSPF process out of the ignore"},

Information About TTL Security Support for OSPFv3 on IPv6 OSPFv3 TTL Security Support for Virtual and Sham Links In OSPFv3, all areas must be connected to a backbone area. If there is a break in backbone continuity, or the backbone is purposefully partitioned, you can establish a virtual link. The virtual link must be configured in the two devices you want to use to connect the partitioned backbone.

Sham links are similar to virtual links in many ways, but sham links are used in Layer 3 Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) VPN networks to connect provider edge (PE) routers across the MPLS backbone. Multihop adjacencies such as virtual links and sham links use global IPv6 addresses that require you to configure TTL security to control the number of hops that a packet can travel. Note If TTL security is enabled, OSPFv3 sends outgoing packets with an IP header TTL value of 255 and discards incoming packets that have TTL values less than the configurable threshold. Because each device that forwards an IP packet decreases the TTL value, packets received via a direct (one-hop) connection will have a value of 255.

Transitioning Existing Networks to Use TTL Security Check If you currently have OSPF running in your network and want to implement TTL security on an interface-by-interface basis without any network interruptions, use the ip ospf ttl-security command and set the hop-count argument to 254. This setting causes outgoing packets to be sent with a TTL value of 255, but allows any value for input packets.

TTL Security Check for OSPF Virtual and Sham Links In OSPF, all areas must be connected to a backbone area. If there is a break in backbone continuity, or the backbone is purposefully partitioned, you can establish a virtual link. The virtual link must be configured in both devices. The configuration information in each device consists of the other virtual endpoint (the other area border router [ABR]) and the nonbackbone area that the two devices have in common (called the transit area.) Note that virtual links cannot be configured through stub areas. Sham links are similar to virtual links in many ways, but sham links are used in Layer 3 Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Network (VPN) networks to connect Provider Edge (PE) routers across the MPLS backbone.

To configure the TTL Security Check feature on a virtual link or a sham link, configure the ttl-security keyword and the hop-count argument in either command. Note that the hop-count argument value is mandatory in this case. Benefits of the OSPF Support for TTL Security Check The OSPF Support for TTL Security Check feature provides an effective and easy-to-deploy solution to protect OSPF neighbor sessions from CPU utilization-based attacks. When this feature is enabled, a host cannot attack an OSPF session if the host is not a member of the local or remote OSPF network, or if the host is not directly IP Routing: OSPF Configuration Guide 358 Configuring OSPF TTL Security Check and OSPF Graceful Shutdown Information About OSPF TTL Security Check and OSPF Graceful Shutdown\n\n\nconnected to a network segment between"},

OSPF Graceful Shutdown The OSPF Graceful Shutdown feature provides the ability to temporarily shut down the OSPF protocol in the least disruptive manner and notify its neighbors that it is going away. All traffic that has another path through the network will be directed to that alternate path. A graceful shutdown of the OSPF protocol can be initiated using the shutdown command in router configuration mode. This feature also provides the ability to shut down OSPF on a specific interface. In this case, OSPF will not advertise the interface or form adjacencies over it; however, all of the OSPF interface configuration will be retained.

Restrictions for OSPFv2 Local RIB This feature is available only for IP Version 4 networks. Information About OSPFv2 Local RIB A router that is running OSPFv2 maintains a local RIB in which it stores all routes to destinations that it has learned from its neighbors. At the end of each SPF, OSPF attempts to install the best (that is, the least-cost) routes to a destination present in the local RIB into the global IPv4 routing table. The global RIB will be updated only when routes are added, deleted, or changed. Routes in the local RIB and Forwarding Information Base (FIB) will not compute when intermediate results are computed during SPF, resulting in fewer dropped packets in some circumstances.

By default, the contents of the global RIB are used to compute inter-area summaries, NSSA translation, and forwarding addresses for type-5 and type-7 LSAs. Each of these functions can be configured to use the contents of the OSPF local RIB instead of the global RIB for their computation. Using the local RIB for the computation may be slightly faster in some circumstances, but because the local RIB has information for only a particular instance of OSPF, using it for the computation may yield incorrect results. Potential problems that may occur include routing loops and black-hole routes. It is recommended that you not change the default values because they are conservative and preserve the current global RIB behavior. By default, OSPF installs discard routes to null0 for any area range (internal) or summary-address (external) prefixes that it advertises to other routers. Installation of a discard route can"},

Installation of a discard route can prevent routing loops in cases where portions of a summary do not have a more specific route in the RIB. Normally, internal discard routes are installed with an administrative distance of 110, while external discard routes have an administrative distance of 254. There may be rare circumstances, however, when some other values are needed. For example, if one OSPF process installs a route that exactly matches an area range configured on another OSPF process, the internal discard routes for the second OSPF process could be given a higher (less desirable) administrative distance.

Information About OSPFv3 Authentication Trailer OSPF NSR Functionality Although OSPF Nonstop Routing (NSR) serves a similar function to OSPF Nonstop Forwarding (NSF), it works differently. With NSF, OSPF on the newly active standby RP initially has no state information. OSPF uses extensions to the OSPF protocol to recover its state from neighboring OSPF devices. For the recovery to work, the neighbors must support the NSF protocol extensions and be willing to act as “helpers” to the device that is restarting. The neighbors must also continue forwarding data traffic to the device that is restarting while protocol state recovery takes place. With NSR, by contrast, the device that performs the switchover preserves its state internally, and in most cases the neighbors"},
{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 824, "text": "device that performs the switchover preserves its state internally, and in most cases the neighbors are unaware of the switchover. Because assistance is not needed from neighboring devices, NSR can be used in situations where NSF cannot be used; for example, in networks where not all neighbors implement the NSF protocol extensions, or where network topology changes during the recovery making NSF unreliable, use NSR instead of NSF.

Broadcast Interface Protection LFA repair paths protect links when a repair path and a protected primary path use different next-hop interfaces.

In OSPFv3, addressing semantics have been removed from the OSPF protocol packets and the main LSA types, leaving a network-protocol-independent core. This means that Router-LSAs and network-LSAs no longer contain network addresses, but simply express topology information. The process of hiding prefixes is simpler in OSPFv3 and suppressed prefixes are simply removed from the intra-area-prefix-LSA. Prefixes are also propagated in OSPFv3 via link LSAs The OSPFv3 Prefix Suppression feature provides a number of benefits.The exclusion of certain prefixes from adverstisements means that there is more memory available for LSA storage, bandwidth and buffers for LSA flooding, and CPU cycles for origination and flooding of LSAs and for SPF computation."},

In addition, security has been improved by reducing the possiblity of remote attack with the hiding of transit-only networks. Globally Suppress IPv4 and IPv6 Prefix Advertisements by Configuring the OSPFv3 Process You can reduce OSPFv3 convergence time by configuring the OSPFv3 process on a device to prevent the advertisement of all IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes by using the prefix-suppression command in router configuration mode or address-family configuration mode.

Information About OSPFv3 VRF-Lite/PE-CE Support for OSPFv3 VRF-Lite and PE-CE Open Shortest Path First version 3 (OSPFv3) operates in nondefault VPN routing and forwarding (VRF) instances for both IPv6 and IPv4 address families and, transports the routes across a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) or a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) backbone. On the provider edge (PE) device, customer routes are installed together by OSPFv3 and BGP in a common VRF or address family and each protocol is configured to redistribute the routes of the other. BGP combines the prefixes redistributed into it with a route-distinguisher value defined for the VRF and advertises them to other MPLS-BGP speakers in the same autonomous system using the VPNv4 or VPNv6 address family as appropriate. The OSPFv3 route selection algorithm prefers intra-area routes across the back-door link over inter-area routes"},
{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 898, "text": "route selection algorithm prefers intra-area routes across the back-door link over inter-area routes through the MPLS backbone. Sham-links are a type of virtual link across the MPLS backbone that connect OSPFv3 instances on different PEs. OSPFv3 instances tunnel protocol packets through the backbone and form adjacencies. Because OSPFv3 considers the sham-link as an intra-area connection, sham-link serves as a valid alternative to an intra-area back-door link. Domain IDs are used to determine whether the routes are internal or external. They describe the administrative domain of the OSPFv3 instance from which the route originates. Every PE has a 48-bit primary domain ID (which may be NULL) and zero or more secondary domain IDs.

{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 960, "text": "f Limiting Adjacencies The OSPF: Limit Simultaneous Adjacency Formations feature allows you to limit to the number of adjacencies that are in “exchange” or “loading” state at the same time. A process limit (PL) determines the number of “forming” adjacencies and applies to all adjacencies for the entire process. The term “forming” refers to adjacencies that are in “exchange” or “loading” state. Adjacencies form in an OSPF area during the initial period after the area is created. The Initial Limit applies when no adjacencies have reached the “full” state in an OSPF area. If there are any “full” adjacencies in the area, the new adjacencies are governed by the Process IP Routing: OSPF Configuration Guide 505\n\n\nLimit. At a given point of time, process limit and initial limit are effective in an OSPF area.

In other words, the maximum number of adjacencies can be exceeded before adjacencies form in one or more areas. The maximum limit can be exceeded by the number of areas minus one. When a limit is reached, adjacencies in a state less than EXCHANGE are terminated. To terminate the adjacency, a hello packet is sent to the neighbor which does not have the neighbor’s device ID. This causes the neighbor to put the adjacency in the INIT state. This prevents a deadlock with the neighbor, which could otherwise happen if the neighbor is blocking an adjacency from forming on a different interface. By causing the neighbor to bring the adjacency to INIT, it allows the neighbor to form an adjacency on a different interface. Packets from unknown neighbors are ignored when the limit has been reached or exceeded. If graceful restart or Cisco nonstop forwarding is configured, the hello packets must be accepted from every neighboring device"},
{"source": "ospf_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 962, "text": "o nonstop forwarding is configured, the hello packets must be accepted from every neighboring device The restarting device must include the neighbors’ device IDs in its hello packets to prevent the adjacency from being dropped by the neighbor. If graceful restart is in configured, the grace link-state advertisements (LSAs) must be sent in a normal mode and not in a throttling mode. When the device is performing graceful restart and if the limit is reached, new adjacencies are allowed to remain in 2-WAY or EXSTART. However, they are prevented from proceeding to EXCHANGE until the number of forming adjacencies is less than the limit. Configuring Adjacency Formations Use the adjacency stagger command to configure the maximum limit and the initial limit for an area in the router or address-family configuration modes. The initial limit must not be greater than the process limit. The default value is 300 and the minimum is 1. If the none keyword is used, the maximum limit is only effective."},

If an initial limit is reached in an area and no adjacencies are forming, no adjacencies will be allowed to form in the area until global number of adjacencies forming is less than the PL. Use the ip ospf adjacency stagger disable or the ospfv3 adjacency stagger disable command to disable staggering on an interface. Adjacencies forming on a disabled interface are counted towards throttling limits. Disabling the throttling on an interface allows exceeding the maximum limit when the maximum limit is reached and a new adjacency forms on an interface where throttling is disabled.

Virtual LANs A VLAN is a logical, software-defined subnetwork. It allows similar devices on the network to be grouped together into one broadcast domain, irrespective of their physical position in the network. Multiple VLANs can be used to group workstations, servers, and other network equipment connected to the switch, according to similar data and security requirements. What is a VLAN? In simple terms, a VLAN is a set of workstations within a LAN that can communicate with each other as though they were on a single, isolated LAN.

Among other things, it means that:  broadcast packets sent by one of the workstations will reach all the others in the VLAN.  broadcasts sent by one of the workstations in the VLAN will not reach any workstations that are not in the VLAN.  broadcasts sent by workstations that are not in the VLAN will never reach workstations that are in the VLAN.  the workstations can all communicate with each other without needing to go through a gateway. For example, IP connections would be established by ARPing for the destination.  IP and sending packets directly to the destination workstation—there would be no need to send packets to the IP gateway to be forwarded on.  the workstations can communicate with each other using non-routable protocols.

{"source": "vlan_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 59, "text": "VLANs The basic reason for splitting a network into VLANs is to reduce congestion on a large LAN. To understand this problem, we need to look briefly at how LANs have developed over the years. Initially LANs were very flat—all the workstations were connected to a single piece of coaxial cable, or to sets of chained hubs. In a flat LAN, every packet that any device puts onto the wire gets sent to every other device on the LAN. As the number of workstations on the typical LAN grew, they started to become hopelessly congested; there were just too many collisions, because most of the time when a workstation tried to send a packet, it would find that the wire was already occupied by a packet sent by some other device.\n\n\nUsing routers to segment LANs | Page 5 This next section describes the three solutions for this congestion that were developed:  Using routers to segment LANs on page 5  Using switches to segment LANs on page 5  Using VLANs to segment LANs on page 6 Using routers to"},
{"source": "vlan_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 60, "text": " Using switches to segment LANs on page 5  Using VLANs to segment LANs on page 6 Using routers to segment LANs The early solution to this problem was to segment the network using routers. This would split the network into a number of smaller LANs. There would be less workstations on each LAN, and so less congestion. Of course, routable data being sent between LANs would have to be routed, so the layer 3 addresses would have to be organized so that each LAN had an identifiable set of addresses that could be routed to—such as an IP subnet or an AppleTalk zone. Nonroutable protocols would have to be bridged, which is not quite so congestion-reducing, because bridges forward all broadcasts. But, at least for unicast packets, a bridge only forwards packets if it knows that the destination address is not in the originating LAN. Using switches to segment LANs As switches became more available, there was a move from chained hubs to a set of hubs connected to a switch. A switch only sends"},
{"source": "vlan_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 61, "text": "able, there was a move from chained hubs to a set of hubs connected to a switch. A switch only sends traffic to a given port if the traffic has to go to that port. So switches have the effect of reducing congestion at workstations, by stopping the workstations from seeing all the traffic from the other ports of the switch. A simple switched network, though, still needs routers to set the boundaries of where broadcasts are sent (referred to as “broadcast containment”). So, the typical LAN was set up as shown below in Figure 1. Figure 1: Typical VLAN bridge or switch workstation LAN segments (Collision Domains) LAN (Broadcast Domain) hub hub bridge or switch router hub hub hub hub\n\n\nPage 6 | Domain terminology Domain terminology The above figure introduces the concept of a LAN segment.

Each LAN segment consists of all the devices attached to a single switch port—the switch stops packets from different ports from colliding with each other. The LAN itself is referred to as a broadcast domain, because if any device within the LAN sends out a broadcast packet, it will be transmitted to all devices in that LAN, but not to devices beyond the LAN. Using VLANs to segment LANs As LANs became larger, data rates became faster, and users desired greater flexibility, the routers in a network started to become a bottleneck. This is because:  routers typically forward data in software, and so are not as fast as switches.  splitting up a LAN using routers meant that a LAN typically corresponded to a particular physical location. This became limiting when many users had laptops, and wanted to be able to move between buildings, but still have the same network environment wherever they plugged in. Switch vendors"},
{"source": "vlan_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 63, "text": "ween buildings, but still have the same network environment wherever they plugged in. Switch vendors started implementing methods for defining “virtual LANs”—sets of switch ports, usually distributed across multiple switches, that somehow interacted as though they were in a single isolated LAN. This way, workstations could be separated off into separate LANs without being physically divided up by routers. At about the same time, hubs became less popular and have been largely replaced by L2 switches. This has made the whole concept of a collision domain somewhat historical. In modern networks, a “collision domain” mostly consists of a single device attached to an L2 switch port, or possibly a PC with something like an IP phone attached to it. So, the layout of the LAN has become more like this next diagram:\n\n\nUsing VLANs to segment LANs | Page 7 Figure 2: Segmented VLAN Instead of the LANs corresponding to physical areas divided from each other by routers, there are virtual LANs"},

For example, all the devices in the various areas labeled “LAN A” all belong to a single virtual LAN—i.e. a single broadcast domain. Advantages of using VLANs: 1. Performance. As mentioned above, routers that forward data in software become a bottleneck as LAN data rates increase. Doing away with the routers removes this bottleneck. 2. Formation of virtual workgroups. Because workstations can be moved from one VLAN to another just by changing the configuration on switches, it is relatively easy to put all the people working together on a particular project all into a single VLAN. They can then more easily share files and resources with each other. To be honest, though, virtual workgroups sound like a good idea in theory, but often do not work well in practice.

It turns out that users are usually more interested in accessing company-wide resources (file servers, printers, etc.) than files on each others' PCs. 3. Greater flexibility. If users move their desks, or just move around the place with their laptops, then, if the VLANs are set up the right way, they can plug their PC in at the new location, and still be within the same VLAN. This is much harder when a network is physically divided up by routers. 4. Ease of partitioning off resources.

It is one thing to say this, it is quite another thing to understand how this is actually achieved. Fundamentally, the act of creating a VLAN on a switch involves defining a set of ports, and defining the criteria for VLAN membership for workstations connected to those ports. By far the most common VLAN membership criterium is port-based. With port-based VLANs, the ports of a switch are simply assigned to VLANs, with no extra criteria. All devices connected to a given port automatically become members of the VLAN to which that port was assigned. In effect, this just divides a switch up into a set of independent sub-switches. Distributing a single VLAN across multiple switches The figure \"Segmented VLAN\" on page 7 is an example of a VLAN-based network. It shows some of VLAN A connected to one switch, and some more of VLAN A connected to another switch. You may be asking “Are these both part of the same VLAN A, or separate VLANs that all happen"},

You may be asking “Are these both part of the same VLAN A, or separate VLANs that all happen to be called VLAN A?” The answer is that they are all parts of the same VLAN—there is a single VLAN A that is spread across two switches. How is this achieved? How does one switch know that when it receives a broadcast packet that it associates to VLAN A that it must also forward that broadcast to other switches? This can be done in a number of different ways, and in the early days of VLANs, just about every one of these ways was tried. Some vendors had their switches use a proprietary protocol to inform each other of their VLAN tables; some vendors used time-divided multiplexing in which different time slots were allocated to different VLANs; other vendors used frame tagging. In the end, frame tagging became the accepted standard. As we will see, in most respects this is a simple and elegant solution. However, it initially had one big downside: it required a fundamental change to the"},

Table 1: Port-based VLAN assignment PORT VLAN 1 1 2 1 3 2 4 1\n\n\nHow does tagging work? | Page 9 How does tagging work? Simply, 4 bytes are inserted into the header of an Ethernet packet. This consists of 2 bytes of Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID) and 2 bytes of Tag Control Information (TCI), as shown in the diagram below: Figure 3: Tagged Ethernet packet TPID is the tag protocol identifier, which indicates that a tag header is following and contains the user priority, Canonical Format Indicator (CFI), and the VLAN ID. User Priority is a 3-bit field that allows priority information to be encoded in the frame. Eight levels of priority are allowed, where zero is"},

Eight levels of priority are allowed, where zero is the lowest priority and seven is the highest priority. The CFI is a 1-bit indicator that is always set to zero for Ethernet switches. CFI is used for compatibility between Ethernet and Token Ring networks. If a frame received at an Ethernet port has a CFI set to 1, then that frame should not be bridged to an untagged port. Then, the VID field contains the identifier of the VLAN. Actually, it is only the VID field that is really needed for distributing VLANs across switches—but the IEEE decided that while they were altering the format of the Ethernet header, they might as well add the User Priority and CFI too. Let us see how this tag makes it simple to distribute VLANs across switches.  Consider a broadcast packet arriving at a switch port. By some criterion, the packet is associated with VLAN 47, i.e. a VLAN with VLAN ID=47. Now, port 17 of this switch is connected to port 12 of"},

This tells switch 1 to send the broadcast out port 17 as a tagged packet, with VID=47 in the tag. And it tells switch 2 to accept that tagged packet and associate it with VLAN 47.  Then, switch 2 will send the packet out all its member ports of VLAN 47, because that is what it does with broadcasts that it has associated with VLAN 47. 2 bytes 2 bytes TPID TCI User priority CFI VID 3 bits 1 bit 12 bits\n\n\nPage 10 | Mixing tagged and untagged packets on the same port Figure 4: Distribute VLANs across multiple switches The tag makes it very easy for the second switch to know what to do with the packet, because the tag marks this packet as belonging to VLAN 47, and switch 2 knows exactly what it should do with"},

So, there really are only two simple rules:  If a port is a tagged member of a VLAN, then any packets sent out that port by that VLAN must have a tag inserted into the header.  If a tagged packet arrives in at a port, and the port is a tagged member of the VLAN corresponding to the VID in the packet's tag, then the packet is associated with that VLAN. With these two simple rules, it is possible to distribute VLANs across multiple switches. Mixing tagged and untagged packets on the same port In the previous section, we discussed using tags to indicate the VLAN membership of packets that are transferred from one switch over to another. But, it is also possible that untagged packets will be transported across that link that joins the two switches.

When those untagged packets arrived at switch 2, what VLAN would switch 2 decide to associate these packets with, given that they do not have a tag to indicate their VLAN membership? Well, in fact, switch 2 would realize that VLAN 56 is the untagged VLAN on the receiving port, so untagged packets would be deemed to belong to VLAN 56. Obviously, a port can be an untagged member of only one port-based VLAN, otherwise there would be uncertainty about what VLAN incoming untagged packets belonged to. This VLAN is often referred to as the native VLAN of the port.

This stops the switch from accepting any untagged packets on the port. In AlliedWare Plus, this is achieved by configuring a port to trunk mode and not configuring a native VLAN on it. In AlliedWare, it is achieved by setting the parameter acceptable=vlan on the port, so that the port will only accept VLAN-tagged packets.

Normal applications on the workstation will never send tagged packets, so there is no requirement for the switch port to accept tagged packets. But, is there any harm if the port does accept tagged packets if they happen to come along? Well, the answer is “quite possibly yes”. If the workstation does send tagged packets, then it is very likely doing so for malicious reasons. To guard against such maliciousness, most switches provide the ability to configure ingress filtering. When ingress filtering is applied to a port, packets will only be accepted into a port if they match the VLAN configuration of that port. So, if the port is an untagged member of one VLAN, and nothing else, then only untagged packets will be accepted on the port.

The S-tag field has an identical structure to the VLAN tag field. The switch that performs the double tagging has two sets of specially designated ports:  Customer edge ports —that face the customer networks from which single-tagged packets are arriving.  Provider ports (or Core ports)— that connect into the service provider infrastructure, on which double-tagged packets are arriving and leaving.

If the packet was originally untagged, then the S-tag becomes the packets one and only tag. Within the service provider infrastructure, the C-tag (inner tag) is ignored and bridging is based on the value of the S-tag.

However, there are other ways of defining VLAN membership. In this section, we will consider another type of VLAN - namely the Protocol-Based VLAN. With this VLAN classification method, different protocol types are assigned to different VLANs. For example, IP defines one VLAN, IPX defines another VLAN, Netbeui yet another VLAN, etc. It is possible that a question will come to your mind at this point, like: “Isn't a VLAN a set of workstations? How does a protocol specify a workstation? Surely a given workstation can send out packets using different protocols (often at the same time), depending on which applications it is running?” At this point, you may be starting to see"},

So, let us look a bit deeper here and get to a better understanding of what VLAN membership means. In fact, a given workstation can belong to multiple VLANs. It could belong to one protocolbased VLAN when sending IP packets, another protocol-based VLAN when sending IPX packets, and yet another different port-based VLAN when sending some other protocol. So, certainly, when analyzing the VLAN setup on a network, it is a mistake to ask “what VLAN does this workstation belong to?” The more meaningful question to ask is “if a packet of such-and-such a protocol arrived at port x of the switch, which VLAN would that packet be associated with?” It is important to really understand the change of mind-set that has just been introduced here.

And, in practice, this is often all that a network administrator wants to achieve. However, once the VLAN configuration on a switch becomes complex, with multiple VLANs of different types all configured on the same port, it is no longer possible to really think about the VLAN from the workstation point of view. It becomes necessary to think of it from the packet point of view. Therefore, it really is vital to think of packets being associated to VLANs when trying to understand VLAN configurations. Any other approach just ends in confusion. The main point is that, when using protocol-based VLANs, it is data streams that are divided into VLANs, not necessarily whole workstations.\n\n\nPage 36 | Protocol based VLAN configuration example Protocol based VLAN configuration example See Table 7 on the next page for the procedure to configure Switch A.

Table 7: Configuration procedure for Switch A (continued) COMMAND DESCRIPTION\n\n\nCounter operation | Page 39 Counter operation In this section we detail two scenarios: in the first scenario the switch is being used at the edge of the network; in the second scenario it is directly connected to an edge switch. In each situation, separate counters are maintained for incoming traffic that is associated with a particular VLAN across a range of ports. This enables both incoming and outgoing traffic volumes to be measured. A port may not be assigned to multiple counter instances so as to count frames (or bytes) within the same VLAN. The byte count includes"},
{"source": "vlan_manual.txt", "chunk_index": 128, "text": "ple counter instances so as to count frames (or bytes) within the same VLAN. The byte count includes frame headers, therefore the byte counter for a VLAN tagged frame will be 4 bytes longer than for an untagged frame. Where a VLAN packet counter instance encompasses ports on a stacked member and the member is removed from the stack, these ports will automatically be removed from the counter instance. If this process removes all ports within a counter instance, then the instance will be deleted. Edge switch scenario This network is shown in Figure 14 on page 40. The total data count is the upload count plus the download packet count Customer A data count The upload data count for customer A is determined by monitoring the inbound VLAN 10 packets on ports 1.0.2 and 1.0.8 (i.e. packets from Customer A's network).
